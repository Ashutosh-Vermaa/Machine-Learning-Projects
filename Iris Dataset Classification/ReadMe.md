## Data Cleansing
In the data cleansing step, i looked for null values, detected and removed duplicate records, outliers from the dataset. 

## Model Architecture
In this experiment, I have implemented multiple models from sckit learn- KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree with the default configurations of the sckit learn library.
