## Data Collection
I have used the iris dataset from Seaborn library

## Data Cleansing
In the data cleansing step, i looked for null values, detected and removed duplicate records, outliers from the dataset. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the dataset, I tried getting insights into it. I used functions like info(), describe(), shape, value_counts(), unique() to get a basic understanding. Then I used kde(), pairplot() functions to get a sense of the shape of data.

## Model Architecture
Followed by EDA, I have implemented multiple models from sckit learn- KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree with the default configurations of the sckit learn library.
